"""file_guard.py — a content-addressed freeze over the repo's gate machinery.

Ported in spirit from the Codex slot repo's ``scripts/file-guard.mjs``: a sha256
baseline over the EXECUTABLE files that enforce this repo's rules — the secret
scanner, the vacuous-green meta-gate (and its fixtures), the gate-canary, and the
drift auditor. It makes "the audit system may not loosen itself" a HARD tripwire.

  --check (default)  hash every protected file, compare to the committed baseline
    (.fileguard.json), and exit 1 on ANY content change / removal / unbaselined add.
    It works on the WORKING TREE, not a git range, so it bites even when a diff-based
    gate's base ref is wrong (the vacuous-green hole gate_canary.py also guards).
  --update (alias --snapshot)  rewrite the baseline. The whole point is that the bump
    then lands IN THE DIFF, where a reviewer sees that the safety machinery changed.

Tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-proof: anyone may change a guarded file AND re-snapshot in
the same commit. The guard only forces that pair into the reviewed diff — detection,
not prevention. Prose contracts (AGENTS.md, SECURITY.md) stay under the softer
audit-drift / secret-scan checks on purpose; this freezes the code that ENFORCES the
rules, not the rules themselves.

Pure standard library. Honors --root (default: the repo root) so a caller can drive
it against a throwaway temp tree.

Exit: 0 clean, 1 drift (or a refused snapshot), 2 missing/corrupt baseline. Every
failure path is a NAMED message, never a bare crash — the same anti-vacuous-green
thesis the guard enforces applies to the guard itself.
